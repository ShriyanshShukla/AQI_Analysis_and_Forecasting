# AQI Analysis & Forecasting
This project analyzes 5 years of Air Quality Index (AQI) data across major Indian cities, performs data cleaning and feature engineering, and uses a machine-learning model to forecast short-term AQI.
A Power BI dashboard is included for detailed exploratory analysis.

1. Project Overview
The aim of this project was to understand pollution patterns in Indian cities and build a short-term forecasting model using historical AQI data.
The work is split into two parts:

Data Processing & Forecasting (Python + Jupyter Notebook)
Exploratory Analysis & Visual Insights (Power BI Dashboard)
